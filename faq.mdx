title: "Free vs. Subscription"
---

Our philosophy is to build and provide the best experiences for our subscribers and, in the meantime, share the benefits of Life Note, journaling, and AI mentors with as many people as possible.

Life Note is supported through subscription, and we will never sell your data.
