## Weather passes

We talk about emotions like they're destinations. "I'm anxious." "I'm happy." As if this is who we are now.

But emotions are more like weather. They arrive. They shift. They pass. You're not *an anxious person*—you're a person experiencing anxiety right now. Tomorrow, the sky might be different.

Your Inner Weather helps you see this.

## How it works

Life Note reads your journal entries and senses the emotional currents running through them.

Not just the words you use, but the texture of how you're feeling. The frustration beneath the surface. The hope you might not have named. The calm that surprised you.

This becomes your Inner Weather—a visual representation of your emotional landscape.

## The visualization

Your Inner Weather appears as a living, shifting scene.

Sunny skies. Gathering clouds. Rain. Storms. Clear nights. Each reflects the emotional tones in your recent journaling.

This isn't judgment. Storms aren't bad. Rain isn't failure. It's just weather—what's happening right now, without permanence.

Sometimes you'll look at your Inner Weather and think: *Yeah, that's exactly right.* The visualization names something you felt but couldn't articulate.

## Patterns over time

Look back at your Inner Weather across weeks or months.

You might notice:

- Certain times of year bring certain weather
- Some events consistently shift your skies
- Recovery patterns after difficult moments
- Unexpected clarity following confusion

These patterns aren't prescriptions. They're mirrors. When you see your emotional rhythms clearly, you relate to them differently. The storm feels less permanent when you've watched storms pass before.

## No right weather

Here's what's radical about Inner Weather: there's no ideal to achieve.

Most apps want to optimize you. More happy, less sad. More productive, less distracted. Always improving, always ascending.

But emotions aren't problems to fix. They're signals to notice. Anxiety might be telling you something important. Sadness might be the appropriate response to loss. Even numbness is information.

Inner Weather doesn't try to change your emotions. It just shows you what's there—without agenda, without judgment.

## Awareness, not analysis

You don't need to psychoanalyze your weather. You don't need to figure out *why* you feel what you feel (though you can, if that's useful).

Sometimes, just noticing is enough.

*Oh, it's been cloudy for a while.*
*Interesting—the sun came out after I journaled about that.*
*I didn't realize how stormy things were until I saw it here.*

Awareness itself is transformation. Not the aggressive kind. The gentle kind—the kind that lets things shift naturally because you're no longer resisting them.

Your Inner Weather is always changing. Just like you.
