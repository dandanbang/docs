## A week is worth reflecting on

Days blur together. Sunday arrives, and you've already forgotten Tuesday's breakthrough or Wednesday's struggle.

The Weekly Letter and Inner Portrait exist to pause time—to help you see your week as a whole, not just a blur of moments.

<Info>
  **Where to find it:** Home → **"Weekly Reflection"** card, or Calendar → Select any week
</Info>

<Note>
  You'll receive a Weekly Letter and Inner Portrait after writing **3 or more journal entries** in a week. This ensures enough depth for meaningful reflection.

## The Weekly Letter

Every week, as long as you've **written 3 journal entries**, your main mentor will then write a letter—personal, thoughtful, addressed specifically to you and your week.

Your mentor reads everything you journal during the week and the previous week. They notice threads you might have missed. They reflect on your growth, your recurring themes, and the challenges you're wrestling with.

You can find the letter in the **Life/Journal Tab**.\
\
You can also turn on the notification so you'll be notified when the letter arrives.

## The Reflection tab

Next to your Weekly Letter, you'll find the **"Reflection"** tab. Here, your week is organized into clear categories:

- **Where You Shined** — moments of growth, small victories, strengths you demonstrated
- **Key Insights** — patterns and realizations that emerged from your entries
- **Challenges** — struggles you're working through, with compassionate acknowledgment

## Inner Portrait

We only have 52 weeks a year. What if every week of our lives is an art piece?

Words can only capture so much. Some truths are better shown than told.

Your **Inner Portrait** transforms your week's emotional journey into a visual art. It's like visiting the museum of your inner world.

Had an anxious week? The portrait might swirl with tension. A week of clarity? Clean lines, calm colors. A week of creative energy? Explosive warmth.

The art isn't generated randomly. It's derived from _your_ words, _your_ emotions, _your_ specific week. No two Inner Portraits are alike—just as no two weeks are alike.

You can save your Inner Portrait to your photos or share it. Some users collect them over time, watching their emotional landscape evolve.

## Why this exists

Productivity apps tell you what you did. Life Note helps you understand who you became.

The Weekly Letter and Inner Portrait aren't retrospectives. They're mirrors. They show you the week you lived, reflected through wisdom and art.

Most of us don't pause to ask: _What did this week mean?_

Now you have a reason to ask. And a mentor to help you answer.
