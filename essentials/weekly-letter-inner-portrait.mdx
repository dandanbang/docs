## A week is worth reflecting on

Days blur together. Sunday arrives, and you've already forgotten Tuesday's breakthrough or Wednesday's struggle.

The Weekly Letter and Inner Portrait exist to pause time—to help you see your week as a whole, not just a blur of moments.

<Info>
**Where to find it:** Home → **"Weekly Reflection"** card, or Calendar → Select any week
</Info>

<Note>
You'll receive a Weekly Letter and Inner Portrait after writing **3 or more journal entries** in a week. This ensures enough depth for meaningful reflection.

## The Weekly Letter

Every week, a mentor writes to you.

Not a summary. Not a report. A *letter*—personal, thoughtful, addressed specifically to you and your week.

Your mentor reads everything you journaled. They notice threads you might have missed. They reflect on your growth, your recurring themes, and the challenges you're wrestling with.

Open the **"Weekly Letter"** tab to read it.

This isn't what you wrote. It's what someone wise sees in what you wrote.

## The Reflection tab

Next to your Weekly Letter, you'll find the **"Reflection"** tab. Here, your week is organized into clear categories:

- **Where You Shined** — moments of growth, small victories, strengths you demonstrated
- **Key Insights** — patterns and realizations that emerged from your entries
- **Challenges** — struggles you're working through, with compassionate acknowledgment

Think of it as your week, distilled. The noise removed. The signal amplified.

## Inner Portrait

Words can only capture so much. Some truths are better shown than told.

Your **Inner Portrait** transforms your week's emotional journey into visual art. Not a literal illustration—something symbolic. Abstract. A mirror for feelings that resist language.

Had an anxious week? The portrait might swirl with tension. A week of clarity? Clean lines, calm colors. A week of creative energy? Explosive warmth.

The art isn't generated randomly. It's derived from *your* words, *your* emotions, *your* specific week. No two Inner Portraits are alike—just as no two weeks are alike.

You can save your Inner Portrait to your photos or share it. Some users collect them over time, watching their emotional landscape evolve.

## Highlighting what matters

As you read your Weekly Letter, some passages will stand out. That's a signal.

**Long-press or select text** to save it to your [Wisdom Collection](/essentials/wisdom-collection). Your Weekly Letters become a source of accumulated wisdom—insights from mentors who know your journey intimately.

## Why this exists

Productivity apps tell you what you did. Life Note helps you understand who you became.

The Weekly Letter and Inner Portrait aren't retrospectives. They're mirrors. They show you the week you lived, reflected through wisdom and art.

Most of us don't pause to ask: *What did this week mean?*

Now you have a reason to ask. And a mentor to help you answer.
