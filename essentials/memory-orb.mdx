## Time travel through your own words

A year ago, you were someone. You had hopes, fears, struggles—some you've forgotten. Some you've overcome. Some you're still wrestling with.

The Memory Orb surfaces journal entries from this same time in previous years. Not random nostalgia—meaningful echoes.

## How it works

The Memory Orb watches the calendar.

When you open Life Note, it checks: *Did you journal around this time last year? Two years ago? Three?*

If so, those entries appear in a glowing orb on your Home screen. A message from your past self, arriving exactly when it might matter most.

Tap the orb to see what you wrote.

## Why this time?

There's something about seasonal rhythms. The person you were last February faced many of the same circumstances you face now—the same weather, the same annual pressures, often similar emotional terrain.

Reading your past self's words during the same season creates connection. You see:

- Problems you solved (that once seemed impossible)
- Growth you've made (that you might have forgotten)
- Patterns you repeat (that you might finally notice)
- Feelings that pass (no matter how permanent they felt)

## The emotional context

When the Memory Orb surfaces an entry, it preserves everything. The words. The mentor who responded. The emotions you were experiencing.

This isn't a clinical archive. It's a living memory. You re-enter that moment as your past self experienced it—with all its intensity, uncertainty, and hope.

## A conversation across time

Sometimes you'll read a past entry and want to respond to yourself. To tell your past self that it got better. To acknowledge how hard that moment was. To marvel at how much you've changed.

The Memory Orb is an invitation to that conversation. Your journal isn't just for the present. It's for the future versions of you who will need to remember.

## Building the orb

The Memory Orb grows richer with time.

Your first year with Life Note, it stays quiet—there's nothing to surface yet. But in year two, entries begin appearing. Year three, the echoes deepen. Year five, you have a decade's worth of conversations with yourself.

This is why consistent journaling matters. Not for the sake of "habit building." But because your future self will thank you for the gift you're creating right now.

Every entry you write today is a potential Memory Orb for the you of next year.

What would you want to tell them?
