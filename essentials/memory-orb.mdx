As you journal, Life Note captures key moments from your entries and organizes them into different types—whether it's a memory of gratitude, a decision, a connection, a challenge, or a breakthrough (a total of 10+ types) —mentors can now understand your life in a more humane way. 

Also, the memories are awaiting you as **Memory Orbs** in a gallery, so you can revisit them anytime. Each orb carries the moment and the 1–2 emotions you felt, making reflection feel lighter and more delightful than rereading long entries.

The memory orb design is inspired by the movie \_Inside Out 2. \_The idea of revisiting my memories through an orb has stuck with me since I first watched the movie, and I'm really excited to bring it into Life Note as this brings us closer to our vision: an inner universe shaped by your journaling, where self-awareness and growth feel more immersive, fun, and useful. 

<Info>
