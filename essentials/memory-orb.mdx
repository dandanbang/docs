## Time travel through your own words

A year ago, you were someone. You had hopes, fears, struggles—some you've forgotten. Some you've overcome. Some you're still wrestling with.

The Memory Orb surfaces meaningful moments from your journaling history. Not random nostalgia—significant memories, classified and preserved.

<Info>
  **Where to find it:** Home → **"Your Memories"** section (unlocks after 15 journal entries)

## Unlocking your memories

The Memory Orb requires 15 journal entries to activate. Before then, you'll see a gentle, pulsing "Memory Seed" on your Home screen—a promise of what's forming as you write.

The seed cycles through soft colors, particles drift upward, occasional sparks hint at the memories crystallizing inside. It's not locked—it's _becoming_.

Once you reach 15 entries, the Memory Orb awakens, ready to show you what you've accumulated.

## The 3D Memory Orb

When unlocked, your memories appear as a beautiful, animated 3D orb. The orb's colors shift based on the emotions captured in your memories—calm blues, joyful golds, the soft pink of love.

Tap the orb to explore your memories in detail. You can:

- Flip through memories one by one
- See the summary of each significant moment
- Tap to revisit the original journal entry
- Filter by memory type or emotion

## Emotions and memory types

Each memory is classified by emotion and type, helping you understand not just _what_ happened but _how it felt_ and _what it meant_.

### Emotions

Your memories carry emotional color:

- **Joy** — Moments of happiness and celebration
- **Calm** — Peaceful clarity and contentment
- **Sadness** — Grief, loss, and tender pain
- **Love** — Connection, trust, and deep affection
- **Anticipation** — Excitement about what's coming
- **Fear** — Anxiety and uncertainty faced
- **Surprise** — Unexpected turns in your journey
- **Anger** — Frustration and righteous fire

### Memory Types

Memories are also categorized by their significance:

- **Milestone** — Major life events and achievements
- **Breakthrough** — Moments of sudden clarity or progress
- **Decision** — Important choices that shaped your path
- **Connection** — Deep bonds with others
- **Gratitude** — Appreciation and thankfulness
- **Discovery** — Learning something new about yourself or the world
- **Challenge** — Difficulties you faced
- **Recovery** — Bouncing back from setbacks
- **Pattern** — Recurring themes you've noticed
- **Commitment** — Promises and dedications you made

## Browsing by type

Below the Memory Orb, you'll find filter chips showing your memory types and how many of each you have.

Tap "All" to see everything, or tap a specific type—like "Breakthrough" or "Gratitude"—to surface memories of that kind. Each chip shows the count, so you can see which types of moments you've collected most.

This makes it easy to find what you need. Having a hard day? Browse your Gratitude memories. Feeling stuck? Revisit your Breakthroughs. The orb becomes a searchable archive of your most meaningful moments.

---

## The emotional context

Each memory preserves the full emotional texture of the moment. Not just what you wrote, but how you felt—the primary emotion, sometimes a secondary one, and the type of experience it represents.

This isn't a clinical archive. It's a living memory. You re-enter that moment as your past self experienced it—with all its intensity, uncertainty, and hope.

---

## A conversation across time

Sometimes you'll read a past entry and want to respond to yourself. To tell your past self that it got better. To acknowledge how hard that moment was. To marvel at how much you've changed.

The Memory Orb is an invitation to that conversation. Your journal isn't just for the present. It's for the future versions of you who will need to remember.

## Building the orb

The Memory Orb grows richer with time.

Your first year with Life Note, it stays quiet—there's nothing to surface yet. But in year two, entries begin appearing. Year three, the echoes deepen. Year five, you have a decade's worth of conversations with yourself.

This is why consistent journaling matters. Not for the sake of "habit building." But because your future self will thank you for the gift you're creating right now.

Every entry you write today is a potential Memory Orb for the you of next year.

What would you want to tell them?
