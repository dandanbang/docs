## Choose who you learn from

Life Note offers guidance from over 1,000 mentors—philosophers, scientists, artists, spiritual teachers, entrepreneurs, and more. Each one brings a distinct worldview, shaped by real lives and real writings.

Our goal? To deliver the most realistic simulated conversation, we aim to deeply understand the mentor's worldview, values, and styles, then extrapolate from the conversation you are having.

  **Where to find mentors:** Mentor tab → Browse mentors

## The mentor library

When you browse mentors, you'll find them organized by **craft, era, and what they are best for**. You can click on the filter button and easily find the ones you are interested in. You can also click on each individual mentor and get to know them more.

Each mentor card shows:

- Their name and portrait
- Their category (what they're known for)
- An overview 
- Their strength and weakness

Tap any mentor to see their full profile.

## Understanding a mentor's voice

Every mentor profile includes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Overview">
    A brief biography—who they were, what they believed, how they lived.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Best For">
    What kinds of questions or struggles is this mentor particularly suited for? Some excel at existential questions. Others make practical decisions. Others at creative blocks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep in Mind">
    An honest note about this mentor's limitations. Every great mind has blind spots. Life Note doesn't hide them—it names them, so you can choose wisely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="A Quote">
    A representative line from their actual work—a taste of how they think and speak.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Following mentors

When you follow a mentor, they become part of your personal circle of guides:

- They appear in your journal writing page
- You can choose the mentor you are following to respond to your journal
- Their wisdom becomes available for reference

To follow or unfollow a mentor, tap the heart icon on their profile.

<Tip>
  Don't just follow mentors who comfort you. Some of the most valuable guidance comes from voices that challenge your assumptions.
</Tip>

## Setting your main mentor

Your **Main Mentor** is the default voice that responds to your **weekly reflection and asks you a daily question** for you to ponder. This is the mind you'll hear from most often.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Tap the profile icon, then Settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Main Mentor">
    Choose from your followed mentors
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Your selection is saved automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can change your Main Mentor at any time. Different seasons of life may call for different guides.

## Blocking mentors

If a mentor's voice doesn't resonate—or actively bothers you—you can block them entirely.

Blocked mentors won't appear in your conversations, suggestions, or the Inspiration tab.

To block a mentor on mobile:

1. Go to Settings → Blocked Mentors
2. Tap "Select Mentors to Block"
3. Search or browse, then tap "Block" next to any mentor

To block a mentor on the web:

1. Go to the Mentor tab
2. Click on the top right button, then just tap block.

You can unblock them later from the same settings screen.

## Why so many voices?

Because wisdom isn't monolithic.

What helps one person may not help another. What you need at 25 may not be what you need at 45. What serves you in grief may not serve you in ambition.

Life Note gives you access to humanity's accumulated wisdom—not as a single prescription, but as a chorus of perspectives you can choose from.

Pick the voices that challenge you, the ones that comfort you, and the ones that see you clearly.
