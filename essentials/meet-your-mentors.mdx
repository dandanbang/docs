## Choose who you learn from

Life Note offers guidance from over 100 mentors—philosophers, scientists, artists, spiritual teachers, entrepreneurs, and more. Each one brings a distinct worldview, shaped by real lives and real writings.

These aren't generic personalities. Marcus Aurelius won't sound like Rumi. Your grandmother's warmth won't echo in Nietzsche's challenge.

**Where to find mentors:** Inspiration tab → Browse mentors, or Settings → Main Mentor

## The mentor library

When you browse mentors, you'll find them organized by craft—Philosopher, Scientist, Artist, Spiritual Teacher, and more.

Each mentor card shows:
- Their name and portrait
- Their category (what they're known for)
- Whether you're following them

Tap any mentor to see their full profile.

## Understanding a mentor's voice

Every mentor profile includes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Overview">
    A brief biography—who they were, what they believed, how they lived.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Best For">
    What kinds of questions or struggles this mentor is particularly suited for. Some excel at existential questions. Others at practical decisions. Others at creative blocks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep in Mind">
    An honest note about this mentor's limitations. Every great mind has blind spots. Life Note doesn't hide them—it names them, so you can choose wisely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="A Quote">
    A representative line from their actual work—a taste of how they think and speak.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Following mentors

When you follow a mentor, they become part of your personal circle of guides:

- They appear in your journal conversations
- You can start chats with them directly
- Their wisdom becomes available to reference

To follow or unfollow, tap the heart icon on any mentor's profile.

<Tip>
Don't just follow mentors who comfort you. Some of the most valuable guidance comes from voices that challenge your assumptions.
</Tip>

## Setting your primary mentor

Your **Main Mentor** is the default voice that responds to your journal entries. This is the mind you'll hear from most often.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Tap the profile icon, then Settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Main Mentor">
    Choose from your followed mentors
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Your selection is saved automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can change your Main Mentor anytime. Different seasons of life may call for different guides.

## Blocking mentors

If a mentor's voice doesn't resonate—or actively bothers you—you can block them entirely.

Blocked mentors won't appear in your conversations, suggestions, or the Inspiration tab.

To block a mentor:
1. Go to Settings → Blocked Mentors
2. Tap "Select Mentors to Block"
3. Search or browse, then tap "Block" next to any mentor

You can unblock them later from the same settings screen.

## Searching and filtering

The mentor library supports search by name or category. Looking for philosophers? Type "Philosopher." Curious about a specific person? Search their name.

This makes it easy to explore new perspectives or find exactly who you're looking for.

---

## Why so many voices?

Because wisdom isn't monolithic.

What helps one person may not help another. What you need at 25 may not be what you need at 45. What serves you in grief may not serve you in ambition.

Life Note gives you access to humanity's accumulated insight—not as a single prescription, but as a chorus of perspectives you can choose from.

Pick the voices that challenge you, the ones that comfort you, and the ones that see you clearly.
