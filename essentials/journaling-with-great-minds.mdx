## Why journaling?

Writing clarifies thinking. It always has.

But there's a difference between writing into a void and writing into a conversation. Life Note gives you both—the sacred privacy of a journal, and the responsive wisdom of a mentor who cares about your growth.

<Info>
**Where to find it:** Open Life Note → Tap the journal bar at the bottom, or tap the **+** button.

## Writing your entry

Start with what's on your mind. A frustration. A question. A moment that stuck with you. A dream you're chasing.

There's no wrong way to begin. But research shows that around **150 words** tends to be the sweet spot—enough depth for meaningful reflection, but not so much that it becomes a chore.

Don't worry about grammar. Don't worry about being profound. Just write what's true.

## When words won't come

Some days, the page stays blank. That's okay.

Tap **"Get Inspired"** to receive a thoughtful prompt—a question designed to unlock reflection without forcing it. These aren't generic journal prompts. They're crafted to meet you where you are.

You can also **speak your entry** using voice journaling. Sometimes thoughts flow better when spoken. Tap the microphone icon and let words come naturally. Life Note will transcribe them for you.

## Choosing a mentor

Here's where it gets interesting.

After you write, you'll choose who responds. Maybe you want the stoic clarity of Marcus Aurelius. The creative fire of Leonardo da Vinci. The psychological depth of Carl Jung. The grounded wisdom of Maya Angelou.

Each mentor brings a different lens to your thoughts.

### The Wisdom Council

Can't decide? Let the **Wisdom Council** choose for you.

This isn't random. The Wisdom Council reads your entry and matches you with the mentor whose perspective is most relevant to what you've written. Anxious about a decision? You might get the Stoics. Exploring creativity? Perhaps Leonardo or Einstein.

Trust the match. You might be surprised who shows up—and why they're exactly who you needed.

## Connecting to your goals

Journaling doesn't exist in isolation. Your thoughts connect to who you're becoming.

When you write an entry, you can optionally **link it to a goal**. Working on being more patient? Journal about a moment that tested your patience, and connect it to that goal. Over time, this creates a rich tapestry—your growth story told through your own words.

Your mentors see this context too. Their reflections become more relevant, more personal, more useful.

## Your language, your way

Life Note speaks your language—literally.

Write in any of **15+ supported languages**, and your mentors will respond in kind. Whether you journal in English, Spanish, Japanese, Hindi, or Arabic, the wisdom adapts to you.

Your native language often carries emotions that translations miss. Use it.

## What happens next

You tap **Submit**. Your mentor reads your words.

And then something remarkable happens: someone who lived centuries ago, who thought deeply about the human condition, reflects on *your* specific situation with *their* unique wisdom.

This isn't a generic response. It's a conversation.

And if you want to go deeper? That's what [Deep Chat](/deep-chat) is for.
