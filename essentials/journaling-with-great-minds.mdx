## Why journaling?

Writing clarifies thinking. It always has.

But there's a difference between writing into a void and writing into a conversation. Life Note gives you both—the sacred privacy of a journal, and the responsive wisdom of a mentor who cares about your growth.

## Writing your first entry

Start with what's on your mind. A frustration. A question. A moment that stuck with you. A dream you're chasing.

There's no wrong way to begin. But research shows that around **150 words** tends to be the sweet spot—enough depth for meaningful reflection, but not so much that it becomes a chore.

Don't worry about grammar. Don't worry about being profound. Just write what's true.

## When words won't come

Some days, the page stays blank. That's okay.

You'll get  **"A Thought to Ponder Today"** where your mentor asks you a question designed to unlock reflection without forcing it. These aren't generic journal prompts. They're crafted to meet you where you are.

You can also \*\*speak \*\*your entry using **voice journaling.** Sometimes thoughts flow better when spoken. Tap the microphone icon and let words come naturally. Life Note will transcribe them for you.

## The Wisdom Council

Just write and hit save. Life Note chooses your **Wisdom Council** for you.

This isn't random. The Wisdom Council reads your entry and matches you with the mentors whose perspectives are most relevant to what you've written.

Anxious about a decision? You might get the Stoics. Exploring creativity? Perhaps Leonardo or Einstein.

Trust the match. You might be surprised who shows up—and why they're exactly who you needed.

The mentors are also aware of each other's perspectives, and they'll give you a diverse set of truths. Each mentor brings a different lens to your thoughts.

You can also **choose your own** mentors. By going to the mentors tab and following the mind, the mentors will appear in your dropdown in the future.

## Journaling Inspiration

If you don't know what to write, tap **'Get Inspired'**, and you will see a curated prompt library. You can write about your morning intention, evening reflection, or things you are grateful for. You can also journal about your dreams and emotions. Life Note also allows you to collect journaling inspirations

## Connecting to your goals

When you write an entry, you can optionally **link it to a goal**. Working on being more patient? Journal about a moment that tested your patience, and connect it to that goal. Over time, this creates a rich tapestry—your growth story told through your own words.

Your mentors see this context too. Their reflections become more relevant, more personal, more useful.

## What happens next

You tap **Submit**. Your mentor reads your words.

And then something remarkable happens: someone who lived centuries ago, who thought deeply about the human condition, reflects on _your_ specific situation with _their_ unique wisdom.

This isn't a generic response. It's a conversation.

And if you want to go deeper? That's what [Deep Chat](/deep-chat) is for.
