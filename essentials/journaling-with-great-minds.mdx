## Why journaling?

Writing clarifies thinking. It always has.

But there's a difference between writing into a void and writing into a conversation. Life Note gives you both—the sacred privacy of a journal, and the responsive wisdom of a mentor who cares about your growth.

## Writing your first entry

Start with what's on your mind. A frustration. A question. A moment that stuck with you. A dream you're chasing.

There's no wrong way to begin. Just dump everything that's on your mind. Don't worry about grammar. Don't worry about being profound. Just write.

Research shows that around **150 words and 3 times a week** tends to be the sweet spot—enough depth for meaningful reflection, but not so much that it becomes a chore.

Some days, the page stays blank. That's okay.

**3 ways to get inspired for journaling**

1. Tap **"Get Inspired"** in the journal writing screen, and from there, you can find a **curated library** of prompts to journal with. You can also **collect journaling inspiration** by highlighting the questions mentors asked you earlier for future journaling sessions.
2. Turn on notifications, and you'll receive **"A Thought to Ponder Today"** daily. Your main mentor will ask you a question designed to unlock reflection without forcing it.
3. You can also use **voice journaling.** Sometimes thoughts flow better when spoken. Tap the microphone icon and let words come naturally. Life Note will transcribe them for you.

## The Wisdom Council

After you are done writing, just hit save. Life Note chooses your **Wisdom Council** for you.

The Wisdom Council reads your entry and matches you with the **most qualified mentors** whose perspectives are most relevant to what you've written. You will also see the qualifications and the reasons why the mentors are recommended to you.

You can also **choose your own** mentors. By going to the mentors tab and following the mind, the mentors will appear in your dropdown in the future.

Once you are ready, just tap **save**.

And if you want to go deeper after reading the responses? Then you can take the conversation further by chatting with the mentors.
