## The conversation continues

A mentor's first response is just the beginning.

You can take the dialogue further—through questioning, challenging, exploring. Deep Chat lets you continue the conversation with your mentor. Ask follow-up questions. Push back on their perspective. Go deeper into ideas that resonate.

This is how the great thinkers learned from each other. Now it's how you learn from them.

<Info>
  **Where to find it:**

  - After submitting a journal entry, → Tap **"Continue Discussion"** on the mentor's response
  - From the Mentor tab → Tap any mentor and then click "Begin Conversation."

## Managing conversations

If you'd like a more focused conversation, you can archive the conversation and start fresh with a topic you'd like to explore with the mentor. Just click on the 3 dots button on the top right, then you'll have the options of

1. **Archiving the conversation:** once a conversation is archived, you'll still be able to see it; it just does not appear in the current conversation context.
2. **Deleting the conversation:** Once deleted, you won't be able to see the conversation again.
3. **View archive:** see all the past archived conversations.
