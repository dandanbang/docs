## Your personal library of profound moments

In the flow of conversation, a mentor says something that stops you. A sentence that crystallizes something you couldn't articulate. An insight you want to carry with you.

Don't let it slip away.

Your Wisdom Collection is where these moments live—saved, searchable, and shareable. Over time, it becomes a curated library of the ideas that shaped your thinking.

<Info>
  **Where to find it:**

  - **To save:** In any mentor response, select text → Tap **"Save to Wisdom"**
  - **To browse:** Home → **"Wisdom Collection"** section → **"See All"**

When a mentor's words resonate:

1. **Long-press** (on mobile) or **click and drag** (on desktop) to select the text
2. A menu appears—tap **"Save to Wisdom"**
3. The passage is added to your collection

You can save from journal responses, Deep Chat conversations, or Weekly Letters. Any moment of insight, captured forever.

## Wisdom Cards

You can easily transform your collected wisdom into wisdom card and share it with people

To create a Wisdom Card:

1. Open your Wisdom Collection
2. Tap any saved insight
3. Select **"Create Card"**
4. Choose a design style
5. Save to photos or share directly

These aren't generic quote images. They're _your_ insights, from _your_ conversations, rendered beautifully.

## Browsing your collection

Your Wisdom Collection grows with you.

Open it to see every insight you've saved, organized and accessible. You can:

- **Search** for specific words or themes
- **Filter by mentor**—see all wisdom from Marcus Aurelius, or only Maya Angelou's insights
- **Scroll through time**—watch how the ideas that move you have evolved

Some users browse their collection in the morning, like a daily devotional. Others revisit it when facing familiar challenges. There's no right way to use it.

## Why this matters

Most books are read once. Most podcasts are heard once. Most conversations are had once.

But wisdom that changes you deserves repetition. The ideas that shifted your perspective six months ago might be exactly what you need to hear again today.

Your Wisdom Collection isn't a graveyard of past insights. It's a living library—always there when you need to remember what you once understood.

The great thinkers kept commonplace books. Notebooks where they collected quotes, ideas, and observations that mattered to them. Leonardo's notebooks. Marcus Aurelius's _Meditations_.

Your Wisdom Collection is yours.
