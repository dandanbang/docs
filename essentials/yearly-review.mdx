## Remember who you were

January 1st arrives. Another year begins. But what happened to the last one?

A year is long enough to contain transformations you've already forgotten. Struggles that felt permanent now feel distant. Goals you set in March that became who you are by December.

The Yearly Review is your mirror for the entire journey. Not a report. Not statistics. A *story*—your story, told back to you.

**Where to find it:** Home → **"Year in Review"** card (appears in late December through early January)

## An immersive experience

The Yearly Review isn't a page. It's a journey.

Full-screen slides. Music that matches the mood. Beautiful visuals drawn from your Inner Portraits throughout the year.

Tap to advance. Let it wash over you. This isn't a time for rushing—it's a time for remembering.

## What you'll see

Your year, illuminated from every angle:

### Stats
How much did you journal? How many conversations did you have? Numbers that reveal commitment to your own growth.

### Themes
The recurring threads that ran through your year. What topics kept appearing? What questions kept asking themselves?

### Goals
What you set out to achieve. What you actually achieved. The distance between the two—and what that distance means.

### Emotions
Your Inner Weather across twelve months. The storms. The sunny stretches. The patterns you might not have noticed while living them.

### Mentors
Who guided you most often? Which voices did you turn to in difficulty, in curiosity, in celebration?

### Progress
Not just toward goals, but toward becoming. The version of you at the start versus the version of you now.

### Archetype
A symbolic representation of your year's essence. Not a personality test—something deeper. A mirror for what this year *meant*.

## The Invitation

At the end of your Yearly Review, you'll receive an **Invitation**.

A prompt for the year ahead. Not a resolution (those rarely work). An invitation—a question or possibility to carry with you into the new year.

The Invitation emerges from your journey. It's not generic self-help. It's personal, drawn from everything you wrote, everything you explored, everyone you became.

You can accept it, modify it, or simply let it sit with you. Either way, it's yours.

## When it appears

The Yearly Review becomes available in **late December** and stays accessible through **early January**.

You need at least a few months of journaling for it to be meaningful. If you started Life Note in November, your first Yearly Review will be thin—and that's okay. Next year's will be richer.

## More than looking back

It might seem like the Yearly Review is about the past. It's not.

It's about integration. Taking scattered moments and weaving them into a coherent narrative. Seeing patterns you couldn't see while living them. Honoring the struggles. Celebrating the growth.

The person who emerges from a Yearly Review is better equipped for the year ahead—not because they have new information, but because they understand themselves more deeply.

You lived this year. Now you'll understand it.

That's the gift you give your future self: a past that makes sense.
