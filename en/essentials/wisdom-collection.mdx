When a mentor’s words touch something deep, you can now **save them in your wisdom collection** for your future reflection.

Your Wisdom Collection is where these moments live—saved, searchable, and shareable. Over time, it becomes a curated library of the ideas that shaped your thinking.

<Info>
  **Where to find it:**

  - **To save:** In any mentor response, select text → Tap **"Save to Wisdom"**
  - **To browse:** Home → **"Wisdom Collection"** section → **"See All"**
</Info>

When a mentor's words resonate:

1. **Long-press** (on mobile) or **click and drag** (on desktop) to select the text
2. A menu appears—tap **"Highlight"**
3. The passage is added to your collection and will appear highlighted when you revisit the mentor responses

You can save from journal responses, Deep Chat conversations, or Weekly Letters.

## Wisdom Cards

You can transform your collected wisdom into a wisdom card and share it with people

To create a Wisdom Card:

1. Open your Wisdom Collection
2. Tap any saved insight
3. Select **"Create Card"**
4. Choose a design style
5. Save to photos or share directly

These aren't generic quote images. They're _your_ insights, from _your_ conversations, rendered beautifully.

## Browsing your collection

Your Wisdom Collection grows with you.

Open it to see every insight you've saved, organized, and accessible. You can:

- **Search** for specific words or themes
- **Filter by mentor**—see all wisdom from Marcus Aurelius, or only Maya Angelou's insights
- **Scroll through time**—watch how the ideas that move you have evolved

Some users browse their collection in the morning, like a daily devotional. Others revisit it when facing familiar challenges. There's no right way to use it.
