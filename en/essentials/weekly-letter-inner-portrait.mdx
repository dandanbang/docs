## A week is worth reflecting on

Days blur together. Sunday arrives, and you've already forgotten Tuesday's breakthrough or Wednesday's struggle.

The Weekly Letter and Inner Portrait exist to pause time—to help you see your week as a whole, not just a blur of moments.

<Info>
  **Where to find it on:** Life/Journal Tab → **"Weekly Reflection"** will show up in the timeline
</Info>

<Note>
  You'll receive a Weekly Letter and Inner Portrait after writing **3 or more journal entries** in a week. This ensures enough depth for meaningful reflection.

## The Weekly Letter

Every week, as long as you've **written 3 journal entries**, your main mentor will then write a letter—personal, thoughtful, addressed specifically to you and your week.

Your mentor reads everything you journal during the week and the previous week. They notice threads you might have missed. They reflect on your growth, your recurring themes, and the challenges you're wrestling with.

You can find the letter in the **Life/Journal Tab**.\
\
You can also turn on the notification so you'll be notified when the letter arrives.

## The Reflection tab

Next to your Weekly Letter, you'll find the **"Reflection"** tab. Here, your week is organized into clear categories:

- **Where You Shined** — moments of growth, small victories, strengths you demonstrated
- **Key Insights** — patterns and realizations that emerged from your entries
- **Challenges** — struggles you're working through, with compassionate acknowledgment

<Info>
  Where to find it on mobile: In the Life tab → Top left corner (a gallery icon) → click to see your gallery of inner portrait

  Where to find it on the web: On the homepage → click the right arrow at the top of the card carousel → your inner portrait is at the third position.
</Info>

We only get 52 weeks each year. At Life Note, we ask ourselves — what if every one of them were a work of art?

Words can only capture so much, and that's why we created the Inner Portrait.

Your **Inner Portrait** transforms your week's emotional journey into a visual art. It's like visiting the museum of your inner world.

The art isn't generated randomly. It's derived from _your_ words, _your_ emotions, _your_ specific week. No two Inner Portraits are alike—just as no two weeks are alike.

You can save your Inner Portrait to your photos or share it.
