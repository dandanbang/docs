Growth follows a simple loop:\
**Action → Experience → Pain → Reflection → Insight → Action again.**

We reflect more deeply after we've taken action, which is why we've designed different ways for you to write down and journal about your goals.

## **Life Goal**

Your life goal is your North Star. It gives meaning to your days and direction to your choices. When you know where you're going, every step becomes purposeful.

**How to Begin**

- **Choose your date:** When do you see this vision coming to life?
- **Name your mission:** What will you devote your life to?
- **Picture the outcome:** What specific change will you bring into reality?
- **Your gift to the world:** What tangible offering will you give to the world?
- **Map your path:** What detailed plans and know-how will get you there?

In Life Note, you can find examples of Life Goals to get inspired. You don't have to have one right now, but you can start with a draft and continue to find out about your why.

Once you've written down your life goal, read it aloud twice a day and check in on Life Note; it'll increase your focus and your likelihood of achieving it.

<Note>
  In 1969, Bruce was rejected by Hollywood and told that he could never be a lead actor. 

  Devastated, he hit one of the lowest points in his life.﻿

  Then he stumbled upon a book that changed everything — _Think and Grow Rich_ by Napoleon Hill.﻿

  The lesson was simple yet profound﻿:﻿﻿

  “Write down your life’s purpose, and read it aloud twice a day.”﻿

  So Bruce sat down and wrote:﻿﻿

  > “I, Bruce Lee, will become the highest-paid Oriental superstar in the United States. In return, I will give the most exciting performances. Starting 1970, I will achieve world fame, and by 1980 I will have \$10 million. I will live the way I please, in inner harmony and happiness.”

  That single page reprogrammed his mind every day. It gave him direction, focus, and conviction — until the world caught up with his vision.

  **That’s the power of having a Life Goal — to live with a purpose designed by you, not the world.**

## Yearly Goal

Every year, you can also write down the goals you have and choose a theme you'd love to focus on.

This helps you break down your larger goal into more actionable, tangible steps throughout the year.

## Create Your Own Goals

And once you've done the big picture thinking and long-term planning, you can start creating goals in Life Note. There are two types of goals in Life Note

- **Milestone Goal:** A goal with a clear deadline and a measurable outcome. Set a clear goal and pursue it with determination. Track your progress and set subgoals that'll help you achieve it along the way.
- **Growth Goals:** These are continuous, ongoing goals with no end, like working out, meditating, and breathing. Create a growth goal, then you can keep track of your streaks, a great way to cultivate a habit.

## Creating a goal

Tap the **\+** button in your Goals tab to create a new one.

A goal can be anything that matters to you:

- _Be more present with my kids_
- _Write my first novel_
- _Build a meditation practice_
- _Worry less about things I can't control_
- _Learn to paint_

Some goals are measurable. Some aren't. Both are valid. Life Note doesn't require metrics—it requires meaning.

You can have up to **10 active goals** at once. Not because more would break the app, but because focus matters. If everything is a priority, nothing is.

## Goal Journaling

Every goal has a journal button; click it to link a journal entry to the goal.

Your mentors respond with awareness of what you're working toward, offering practical advice and a mindset that helps you along the way. And you can also see all the journal entries under a goal; it's a great way to reflect on the journey.
