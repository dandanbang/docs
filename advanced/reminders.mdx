## Why reminders matter

Journaling works best as a regular practice. But life gets busy. Days slip by. That's where reminders come in—not as nagging, but as gentle invitations to pause and reflect.

Life Note lets you set up to 10 custom reminders, each tailored to your schedule.

## Managing your reminders

Each reminder you create appears in your Notifications settings. From here you can:

- **Toggle on/off** — Temporarily disable a reminder without deleting it
- **Edit** — Change the time or days
- **Delete** — Remove the reminder entirely

You can have up to 10 reminders active at once. Maybe one for morning reflection and another for evening review. Maybe different reminders for weekdays versus weekends.

## Weekly reflection reminder

Beyond your custom journal reminders, Life Note offers a separate **Weekly Reflection Reminder**. When enabled, you'll receive a notification to reflect on your week's journaling.

This pairs naturally with the Weekly Letter feature—a chance to see patterns across your entries and receive synthesized insights.

Toggle this on or off in the "Other Notifications" section of your Notifications settings.

## Notification permissions

For reminders to work, Life Note needs permission to send you notifications.

If you haven't granted permission yet, you'll see a prompt when you first visit the Notifications settings or try to create a reminder. Tap "Open Settings" to enable notifications for Life Note in your device settings.

<Note>
  On iOS, you'll need to allow notifications in your device Settings. On Android, you may be prompted directly within the app.

## Finding the right rhythm

There's no universal "best time" to journal. Some people find mornings work well—capturing thoughts before the day takes over. Others prefer evenings—processing what happened and letting go before sleep.

Experiment. Start with one reminder at a time that feels natural. Add more only if they help rather than feel like pressure.

The goal isn't to journal every time a reminder appears. It's to keep the invitation open—so that when you're ready to write, you remember that you can.
