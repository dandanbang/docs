## The bridge between wanting and doing

You have goals. Big ones, maybe. But big goals don't get achieved in big moments. They get achieved in small ones—daily decisions, tiny steps, consistent actions.

Aligned Actions are those steps. Small, meaningful, connected to who you're becoming.

## How they appear

Aligned Actions aren't assigned by an app that doesn't know you. They emerge from _your_ journaling and _your_ goals.

Life Note reads your entries. It understands what you're working toward. And it suggests actions that make sense for where you are right now.

Working on being more present? An Aligned Action might be: _"Put your phone in another room during dinner tonight."_

Trying to write more? Perhaps: _"Write one paragraph about anything before lunch."_

These aren't generic self-help suggestions. They're derived from your specific context.

## Completing actions

When an Aligned Action appears on your Home screen:

- **Tap to complete** when you've done it
- The action disappears, and new ones may appear
- Your progress connects back to your goals

There's no penalty for skipping. No streak to protect. Just an invitation to act—aligned with who you want to be.

## The daily welcome

When you open Life Note each morning, Aligned Actions greet you.

Not a to-do list. Not demands. Just gentle suggestions: _Here are a few things that would move you forward today._

Some users check their Aligned Actions like a morning ritual. Others glance at them when they need direction. Use them however serves you.

## Goals without action

Here's a truth: goals without action are just wishes.

You can set a goal to "be more patient." You can journal about patience. You can read about patience. But until you _practice_ patience in a specific moment, nothing changes.

Aligned Actions close that gap. They take your aspirational self and ground it in the concrete: _Today, in this situation, here's how that goal could come alive._

## Small is the point

Don't dismiss an Aligned Action because it seems too small.

A five-minute walk doesn't seem like much. But a five-minute walk every day changes your relationship with movement. A single paragraph doesn't seem like writing. But a paragraph a day is a book a year.

The smallest action, aligned with who you're becoming, creates momentum. And momentum changes everything.

Aligned Actions aren't about productivity. They're about becoming—one small step at a time.
