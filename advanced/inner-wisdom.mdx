## Your past self has answers

After you've journaled for a while, something interesting happens. Your entries start to contain patterns—recurring themes, hard-won insights, moments of clarity you may have forgotten.

Inner Wisdom is a feature that lets you ask questions and receive answers drawn from your own journaling history. Not generic advice. Your own words, your own discoveries, your own wisdom—surfaced when you need it.

<Info>
  **Where to find it:** Home → "Talk to Your Inner Wisdom" section (unlocks after 10 journal entries)

Inner Wisdom requires 10 journal entries to activate. This isn't an arbitrary gate—it's a minimum threshold to have enough material for meaningful insights.

Before 10 entries, you'll see the section on your Home screen in a muted state with a message: _"10 entries to meet yourself."_

Once you reach 10 entries, the section comes alive. Tap "Ask" to begin.

## How it works

When you ask a question, Inner Wisdom searches through your journal history—not just for keywords, but for meaning. It finds entries where you've touched on similar themes, faced similar challenges, or discovered relevant insights.

Then it synthesizes a response that:

- References your actual past entries
- Weaves together threads from different moments
- Speaks in a tone that honors your own voice

You can tap on any referenced journal entry to revisit the original—seeing the full context of what you wrote.

## What to ask

Inner Wisdom works best with reflective questions:

- _"What have I learned about patience?"_
- _"How have I handled uncertainty in the past?"_
- _"What patterns do I see in my relationships?"_
- _"What advice would I give myself about work?"_
- _"What brings me peace?"_

You're essentially having a conversation with the accumulated you—the version of yourself that exists across all your entries.

## Suggested prompts

If you're not sure what to ask, Life Note offers suggested prompts. These are personalized based on your journaling themes. Tap a suggested prompt to send it directly.

After each conversation, a new prompt appears—an invitation to keep exploring.

---

## Voice input

Like the main journal, Inner Wisdom supports voice input. Tap the microphone icon to speak your question rather than type it.

This can feel more natural for reflective questions—like actually asking yourself something out loud.

<Note>
  Voice input is a Premium feature with a monthly limit.

## Privacy and encryption

All Inner Wisdom conversations are encrypted, just like your journal entries. The analysis happens securely, and your conversations remain private.

When you see references to past entries in a response, those are drawn from your encrypted journal—visible only to you.

## The deeper purpose

Inner Wisdom isn't meant to replace reflection. It's meant to surface what you already know—things you've discovered but might have forgotten, patterns you've noticed but haven't named.

The more you journal, the richer this becomes. Your entries aren't just records of the past. They're seeds of wisdom for the future.

Every entry you write today might contain an answer you'll need tomorrow.
