After you've journaled for a while, something interesting happens. Your entries start to contain patterns—recurring themes, hard-won insights, moments of clarity you may have forgotten.

Inner Wisdom is a feature that lets you ask questions and receive answers drawn from your own journaling history. Not generic advice. Your own words, your own discoveries, your own wisdom—surfaced when you need it.

<Info>

  **Where to find it on the web:** On the homepage → click the right arrow at the top of the card carousel → your inner portrait is at the 6th card.

## How it works

When you ask a question, Inner Wisdom searches through your journal history—not just for keywords, but for meaning. It finds entries where you've touched on similar themes, faced similar challenges, or discovered relevant insights.

Then it synthesizes a response that:

- References your actual past entries
- Weaves together threads from different moments
- Speaks in a tone that honors your own voice

You can tap on any referenced journal entry to revisit the original—seeing the full context of what you wrote.

## What to ask

Inner Wisdom works best with reflective questions:

- _"What have I learned about patience?"_
- _"How have I handled uncertainty in the past?"_
- _"What patterns do I see in my relationships?"_
- _"What advice would I give myself about work?"_
- _"What brings me peace?"_

You're essentially having a conversation with the accumulated you—the version of yourself that exists across all your entries.
