## Goals aren't checkboxes

A checkbox is binary. Done or not done. Success or failure.

But becoming who you want to be isn't binary. It's a journey—sometimes forward, sometimes sideways, always changing.

Life Note treats goals differently. Here, a goal is a declaration: _This is who I'm becoming. This is what matters to me._ And everything you do in the app—journaling, conversations, reflections—connects back to that declaration.

## Creating a goal

Tap the **\+** button in your Goals tab to create a new one.

A goal can be anything that matters to you:

- _Be more present with my kids_
- _Write my first novel_
- _Build a meditation practice_
- _Worry less about things I can't control_
- _Learn to paint_

Some goals are measurable. Some aren't. Both are valid. Life Note doesn't require metrics—it requires meaning.

You can have up to **10 active goals** at once. Not because more would break the app, but because focus matters. If everything is a priority, nothing is.

## Goal types and customization

Goals come in different shapes:

- **Ongoing** — habits and ways of being you want to cultivate (_"Be more patient"_)
- **Project-based** — something with a clear end point (_"Finish my book"_)
- **Time-bound** — connected to a deadline (_"Run a 5K by June"_)

Customize how your goal appears. Give it an icon. Write a description that inspires you. Make it yours.

## Progress tracking

How do you track progress on "being a better listener"?

You don't count it. You _notice_ it. Life Note helps you notice.

When you journal about a goal, your entries become evidence of your journey. Over time, you see:

- How often you're thinking about this goal
- What challenges keep appearing
- What breakthroughs you've had
- How your relationship with the goal evolves

This isn't a progress bar. It's a story—your story, told through your own words.

## Mentor Visions

Periodically, your mentors will offer **Visions** on your goals.

A Mentor Vision is an insight—based on your journaling—about your relationship with a goal. Maybe Marcus Aurelius notices you're being too hard on yourself. Maybe Maya Angelou sees a pattern of self-doubt you haven't acknowledged.

These Visions appear on your goal page, offering wisdom you didn't ask for but might need.

## Journaling in context

When you [write a journal entry](/essentials/journaling-with-great-minds), you can link it to a goal.

This creates connection. Your entry isn't just thoughts floating in space—it's a chapter in the story of your becoming. Your mentors respond with awareness of what you're working toward. Your Weekly Letter reflects on your goal progress.

Goals without journaling are static. Goals with journaling come alive.

---

## Completing a goal

Some goals reach an end point. You finish the book. You run the race. You make peace with something.

When that happens, mark the goal **complete**. It moves to your archive—a record of who you've become, waiting for you to revisit someday.

Not every goal gets completed. Some evolve into new goals. Some get abandoned (and that's okay too). The point isn't completion. The point is engagement.

## A different relationship with goals

Most goal-tracking apps treat you like a machine. Input effort. Output results. Track metrics. Optimize.

But you're not a machine. You're a person—complex, contradictory, constantly growing. Your goals should reflect that.

Life Note doesn't nag you about goals. It doesn't guilt you about missed targets. It simply keeps your aspirations visible, connected to your journaling, illuminated by wisdom.

The goal is growth. Everything else is just details.
