### **Introducing Aligned Action**

Now, after every journal entry, your mentor will suggest **two small but meaningful actions** — based on your life goal, yearly goal, and recent reflections.

They’re _science-backed and time-tested steps_ designed to help you create momentum and changes in your life so you can start aligning what might seem off. 

You can click on the aligned actions card and even turn them into goals that can be tracked and journal with.
