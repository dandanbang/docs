## Weather passes

We talk about emotions as if they were destinations. "I'm anxious." "I'm happy." As if this is who we are now.

But emotions are more like the weather. They arrive. They shift. They pass. You're not _an anxious person_—you're a person experiencing anxiety right now. Tomorrow, the sky might be different.

Your Inner Weather helps you see this.

- **Trends**: if certain emotions have been more present and emerging
- **Emotion map:** based on emotion science, you can see the 8 categories that represent the fundamental ways humans experience feeling, and understand the message behind it.

## Awareness, not analysis

You don't need to psychoanalyze your weather. You don't need to figure out _why_ you feel what you feel (though you can, if that's useful).

Sometimes, just noticing is enough. _Oh, it's been cloudy for a while._ _Interesting—the sun came out after I journaled about that._ _I didn't realize how stormy things were until I saw it here._

Awareness itself is a transformation. Not the aggressive kind. The gentle kind—the kind that lets things shift naturally because you're no longer resisting them.

Your Inner Weather is always changing. Just like you.
