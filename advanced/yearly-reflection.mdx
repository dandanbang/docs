![Yearly Reflection](/images/yearly-reflection.png)

As every year approaches its end, comes the natural season of reflection. 

If you write **15+ journal entries during the year**, Life Note will then craft **your story to help you reflect.**

You can also chat with all your yearly entries—and reflect on questions such as: 

- **What should I celebrate in 2026? **
- **What challenges helped me grow?**
- **What should I let go of as I enter 2026?**

<Info>
  **Where to find it:** Life/Journal → **"Year in Review"** card
