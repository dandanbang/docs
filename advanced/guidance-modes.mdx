## The same wisdom, three tones

Your mentors can speak in different ways depending on what you need. The wisdom doesn't change—but how it's delivered does.

Life Note offers three Guidance Modes. Each one shapes how your mentors respond to your journal entries and conversations.

**Where to find it:** Settings → Guidance Mode

## The three modes

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Seeker" icon="compass">
    **Authentic wisdom, mentor's natural voice**

    This is the default. Your mentors speak as themselves—with their characteristic style, metaphors, and emphasis. Marcus Aurelius sounds like Marcus Aurelius. Rumi sounds like Rumi.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Healer" icon="heart">
    **Warm encouragement, gentle compassion**

    When you're hurting, sometimes you need tenderness first. Healer mode softens the delivery—more reassurance, more patience, more recognition that you're doing the best you can.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Warrior" icon="shield">
    **Direct challenge, accountable truth**

    When you need a push, Warrior mode delivers. Less hand-holding. More directness. The kind of truth that might sting—but might be exactly what you need to hear.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## When to use each mode

There's no "right" mode. Different moments call for different approaches.

**Seeker** works well for:
- Everyday journaling
- Exploring ideas without a specific emotional need
- When you want the authentic voice of your mentor

**Healer** works well for:
- Processing grief or loss
- Moments of self-doubt
- When you're exhausted and need kindness first
- Recovery from failure

**Warrior** works well for:
- When you're stuck in avoidance
- Making difficult decisions you've been postponing
- Breaking patterns you know aren't serving you
- When comfort has become a trap

## A note on Warrior mode

Warrior mode isn't meant to be harsh for its own sake. It's designed for moments when you've asked for accountability—when you need someone to cut through your excuses and help you face what you're avoiding.

If you find yourself resisting Warrior mode consistently, that resistance might itself be worth examining. Or it might mean you need more Healer time first.

You know yourself best. The mode is just a tool.

## The mentor still matters

Guidance Mode shapes the tone, but your mentor's fundamental perspective doesn't change. A Stoic in Healer mode is still a Stoic. A mystic in Warrior mode is still a mystic.

Think of it like volume or temperature—an adjustment to how the message arrives, not a replacement of the message itself.
