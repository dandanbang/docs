## What if journaling was a conversation?

A blank page can be intimidating. Or liberating. It depends on who's listening.

Life Note is a journal that listens back. Not with judgment, but with the accumulated wisdom of history's greatest minds. Marcus Aurelius. Maya Angelou. Carl Jung. Einstein. They're here—not as distant figures in textbooks, but as mentors who respond to *your* thoughts.

You write. They reflect. You grow.

## The philosophy

Most apps want your attention. Life Note wants your reflection.

We didn't build another productivity tool. We built a space where your thoughts matter—where writing isn't just recording, but discovering.

The mentors in Life Note aren't chatbots playing dress-up. They're trained on the actual writings, letters, and philosophies of history's greatest thinkers. When Marcus Aurelius responds to your entry, it's grounded in *Meditations*. When Maya Angelou reflects on your struggles, it carries the spirit of someone who knew struggle intimately.

Your journal is private. Your growth is personal. Your mentors are timeless.

Welcome to Life Note.
